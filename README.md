## The project
Having a solid portfolio as a developer is akin to having a good RBI as a pro baseball player. Hence, why this project is a vital task to not only create but to grow and maintain along the way.  I feel mostly confident in the skills I learned and have utilized so far and I know that my skills can grow tremendously the more I practice. This is a good example of my skills thus far. Please take some time to explore this updated version of my portfolio.
